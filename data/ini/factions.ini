; ----------------------------------------------------
; To add a new faction just extend the list under "Factions" with the intended name.
; To enable it, add to the current number right underneath the title e.g. 12  => 13
; The number simply serves to notify the game that it exists.
; After that you can copy and paste one of the original faction configurations to use as a template.
; For debugging, use 'DebugAll = Yes' in the Faction Index.
