                <h1>Nutrition Tips</h1>

        <p>
        Every meal should contain 3 very important nutrients: Protein, low-glycemic carbohydrates, and essential fats.
        </p>
        <p>
        Drink plenty of water throughout the day!
        </p>
        <p>
        Do not fry foods. Grill, bake, steam, all with low heat. 
        </p>
        <p>

        Do not use butter, margarine, or sugar.  
        </p>
        <p>
        Stay away from white bread, white rice, white pasta, and any other refined carbohydrates.
        </p>
        <p>
        Supplements that are recommended to add to the diet: Fish Oil, Alpha Lipoic Acid, DMAE, Vitamin C Ester, Lecithin.  
        </p>
        <p>
        Go to a bookstore and buy a book in the health section on Glycemic Index. This will help you understand which carbohydrates are good and bad.  
        </p>

        <p>
        Avoid smoking and excess alcohol consumption. A glass of red wine a day is acceptable, and Resveratrol, a phytoalexin found in the skin of red grapes, is a very good anti-oxidant, which has anti-inflammatory, anti-viral properties, and good heart health properties. 
        </p>

                <h1>Skin Nutrition Lifestyle Programme</h1>

        <p>
        Skin Nutrition is passionate about age-reversal and to achieve maximize results we have developed a total body-beauty/wellness concept encompassing our Essential Anti-Oxidant Face range of products that will consistently and effectively fight wrinkle causing inflammation, our Advanced Peptide Therapy Facial range with remarkable  wrinkle reduction and resurfacing properties, our Body Beautiful Body range containing active ingredients with potent restorative properties, and our Body Beautiful Nutrition range designed to optimally support cellular nutrition to promote beautiful skin, hair and nails, as well as a beautiful, lean, shapely figure.
        </p>
        <p>
        Our goal at Skin Nutrition is to take 10 years off your looks and while our skin care products and supplements will go a long way to achieve this goal, diet will also have an important role to play. 
        </p>
        <p>
        Your diet can significantly contribute to pre-mature ageing and excess wrinkling by creating cellular inflammation.  High glycemic foods, (foods that easily convert to glucose in your body) are the main culprits and should be eliminated or cut down significantly. To prevent the cause of cellular inflammation we recommend an anti-inflammatory diet that is rich in nutrients, anti-oxidants, essential fatty acids, and low in high glycemic foods.
        </p>
        <p>

        Every meal should contain 3 very important nutrients:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Protein</li>
            <li>Low-glycemic carbohydrates</li>
            <li>Essential fats</li>
        </ul>
        <p>

        An example of the ideal daily diet should look something like this:
        </p>
        <p>
        <strong>Breakfast</strong><br />
        2 boiled or poached eggs, 1 portion of sweet melon or serving of berries or apple, and small bowl of oats with no sugar. The apple can be grated in the oats for flavour. Use skim milk or soy milk if desired. Cup of green tea. No fruit juice. Take 2-3 High-quality fish oil or Flaxseed oil capsules, and 2 Skin Nutrition Beautiful Body Complex capsules. 
        If in a hurry, a Skin Nutrition Omega 3 Shake can be substituted for breakfast. To make it extra filling add a cup of oats to it in the blender.
        </p>
        <p>
        <strong>10:00am Snack</strong><br />
        Skin Nutrition Omega 3 Shake or Skin Nutrition Omega 3 Bar and a handful of raw almonds. Take 2 DMAE capsules.
        </p>

        <p>
        <strong>Lunch</strong><br />
        Skinless steamed chicken breast with brown rice or lentils and steamed veggies or salad with avocado.
        <br />
        Or
        <br />
        Tuna (in water) with avocado, sliced pineapple, may also be mixed <br />
        with fat free cottage cheese, and any amount of any of the following: <br />

        Tomato<br />
        Lettuce <br />
        Onions <br />
        Cucumber<br />
        </p>
        <p>
        You may dribble extra virgin olive oil over this. 
        </p>

        <p>
        Glass of water
        </p>
        <p>
        <strong>3:00pm Snack</strong><br />
        Skin Nutrition Omega 3 Bar or nonfat yoghurt, raw almonds, and 1 apple or portion of sweet melon or berries. Take 2 Alpha Lipoic Acid capsules and 2 Vitamin C Ester capsules. 
        </p>
        <p>
        <strong>Dinner</strong><br />

        Lean meat, chicken breast fillet, or fish, deep green leafy salad with avocado and or steamed veggies. 
        </p>
        <p>
        Dribble extra virgin olive oil over the salad/veggies with dribbled extra virgin olive oil. 
        </p>
        <p>
        Glass of water
        </p>
        <p>
        <strong>Evening snack</strong><br />

        An apple or pear, and a palm full of raw almonds. 
        </p>
        <p>
        *Remember; the above is just an example of what should be eaten on a daily basis. Do not stick to the same foods daily as this will lead to diet boredom, which in turn could lead to eating the wrong foods. Add as much variety as possible! Eat five small meals a day as per the above example.   
        </p>
        <p>
        <strong>Exercise</strong><br />
        Exercise is vital for good health and plays a very important part of our age-reversal philosophy. Exercise of almost any kind has an anti-inflammatory effect on our cells, improves blood flow and nutrient and oxygen distribution to our cells, improves mood, increases energy, and reduces stress.   
        </p>
        <p>

        There are two types of exercise we recommend: cardiovascular and muscle strengthening. Cardiovascular exercise includes walking, bicycling, running, or swimming. 
        </p>
        <p>
        Cardiovascular exercise raises your heart rate, increases blood circulation, improves nutrient absorption by the cells, increases oxygen utilization, and oxygen is the basis of all energy production. Higher energy levels allow the cells to repair themselves faster. Cardiovascular exercise also raises your metabolism which in turn burns fat and converts food to energy quicker. 
        </p>
        <p>
        Muscle strengthening exercise or resistance training increases strength, muscle mass, which will improve metabolization of blood sugar quicker and low sugar levels prevents inflammation. It can also improve bone density and bone density can decrease with age, especially with postmenopausal women who are prone to osteoporosis. It also improves blood flow and cell nutrient absorption, increases growth hormone production while reducing stress and lowers levels of a destructive hormone called cortisol, which is detrimental for age-reversal. For the skin, this also means increased cell growth and repair as well as improved collagen production.
        </p>

        <h1>Skin Nutrition Cellulite Therapy</h1>

        <p>
        The fat that has risen to just underneath the surface of the skin (giving that ugly orange peel appearance of cellulite), should actually be buried deep within the structure of the skin so that it is not visible.
        </p>
        <p>
        The reason why these fat cells migrate to underneath the surface of the skin is dehydration of the dermis of the skin. If fat cells are buried deep down in the lower layers of the skin and are surrounded by well-hydrated connective tissue, they do not cause problems. 
        </p>
        <p>
        Furthermore, the connective tissues of the deep skin layers lose their water and become dehydrated because of damage caused by free radicals. You may have heard about free radicals with regards to the damage they cause to blood vessels and other tissues leading to heart disease and cancer and other degenerative diseases and conditions. <br />
        Free radicals are formed by exposure to cigarette smoke, pollution, sunlight, stress hormones, and unbalanced diets that are rich in simple carbohydrates and trans-fatty acids. 
        </p>

        <p>
        Drinking vast quantities of water on its own to rehydrate the skin will not prevent cellulite, diet and lifestyle must be improved as well. 
        </p>
        <p>
        <strong>Diet Tips</strong><br />
        Follow the Skin Nutrition diet which is rich in protein, low glycemic carbohydrates, essential fats, and antioxidants and protective nutrients to combat free radicals and tissue damage. Such a diet would include most fresh fruits and vegetables, particularly those that are rich in vitamin C, beta-carotene, lycopene and other phytochemicals, which have an antioxidant effect. 
        </p>
        <p>
        The diet should also be rich in lecithin, a nutrient that can help repair tissue cells in the skin. Foods rich in lecithin are eggs, soybeans and products made from soybeans such as tofu and soymilk, brassica vegetables (cabbage, cauliflower, and broccoli), spinach, peanuts, lettuce and apples. We also recommend that people battling with cellulite should take a lecithin supplement on a daily basis (such supplements can be purchased at chemists or health shops). 
        </p>

        <p>
        Essential fatty acids are found in high-quality fish oil, flaxseeds, flaxseed oil, avocados, walnuts, Brazil nuts, almonds, rapeseed, oily fish, and omega-3 enriched foods such as the omega-3 eggs and milk that are available in most supermarkets. These foods will also help to improve tissue cell hydration in the skin. The Skin Nutrition Omega 3 capsules are also a good source. 
        </p>
        <p>
        Lean protein foods such as lean meat (venison, ostrich), fish, poultry, fat-free milk, yoghurt, cottage cheese, and legumes provide amino acids to boost production of connective tissues such as elastin and collagen so that they are capable of taking up more water. 
        </p>
        <p>
        Finally, the diet should contain glucosamine, which is primarily found in seafood (crabs, oysters, prawns). If you don't include these foods in your diet on a regular basis you can take a glucosamine supplement (buy at chemist or health shops) on a daily basis. <br />
        The diet should not contain trans-fatty acids, which are found in margarine, pastries, pies, and cakes made with commercial margarine. Other saturated fats found in butter, visible fat on meat, poultry skin, processed meat products like most sausages, and fatty cheeses, should also be avoided. 
        </p>

        <p>
        <strong>Additional aids to fight cellulite</strong><br />
        Use Skin Nutrition Body Beautiful Cellulite Treatment regularly, and to optimize its effectiveness message it into the cellulite prone areas. <br />
        The skin will react well to gentle exercise like going for walks to improve blood flow in the cellulite prone areas and the rest of the body. 
        </p>
        <p>
        <strong>Things that boost cellulite</strong><br />
        The following should be avoided at all cost, because they promote cellulite formation: <br />

        Any foods that contain trans-fatty acids (cakes, fatty snacks, fatty meat etc.) or are overcooked (this destroys vital nutrients) 
        </p>
        <p>
        Smoking (it reduces blood flow to the skin, destroys vitamin C and is loaded with pollutants) 
        </p>
        <p>
        Exposure to excess sun, pollution of stress 
        </p>
        <p>
        Liposuction (we need the cushion of fat under our skins for support and removing it may promote cellulite) 
        </p>

        <p>
        Constrictive clothing (cuts off circulation) 
        </p>

        <h1>Skin &amp; Diet</h1>

        <p>
        The topicals and supplements will consistently and effectively fight wrinkling causing cellular inflammation, dramatically improving the way you look and feel. But to really maximize the effectiveness of both and to prevent the cause of the cellular inflammation we recommend an anti-inflammatory diet that is rich in nutrients, anti-oxidants, Essential Fatty Acids, and low in high glycaemic foods.
        </p>
        <p>
        Diet is the main cause of cellular inflammation. High glycaemic foods, (foods that easily convert to glucose in your body) are the main culprits and should be eliminated or cut down significantly.
